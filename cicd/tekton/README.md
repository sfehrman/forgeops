# Tekton pipelines

This demonstrates the use of tekton to build and deploy environments in a cluster using the skaffold and kaniko builder.
The entire build is done in the cluster itself. No external tooling is required.

## Pre-reqs

* Create a `kaniko-secret` in the default namespace. `kubectl create secret generic kaniko-secret --from-file=kaniko-secret`.
   The secret is the GCP service account json that has privileges to push/pull images to gcr.io
* Optional: install the tkn cli tool. More information: https://github.com/tektoncd/cli
  You can perform actions like:
    tkn pipelinerun logs nightly-pipeline-run-lf7tn -f -n nightly #get pipeline logs
    tkn -n nightly pipeline start nightly-pipeline -s tekton-worker #start a pipeline

## Run

Run the shell script `forgeops/cicd/tekton/install-tekton.sh` to install tekton in your cluster. Then, run the `install-pipeline.sh` script for each desired pipeline.

The Tekton dashboard is also included in this install. To map the dashboard, you can run:

```bash
# Map the svc port
kubectl --namespace tekton-pipelines port-forward svc/tekton-dashboard 9097:9097
# open http://localhost:9097 in your browser
```
