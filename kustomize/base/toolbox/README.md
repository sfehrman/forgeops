# Forgeops CDK Toolbox

Deployment creates a container that hosts an in-cluster development toolbox for building and deploying the ForgeRock platform on Kubernetes.


## Requirements

* A cluster that supports [in cluster builds via kaniko](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko#running-kaniko-in-a-kubernetes-cluster) _hint: `bin/gke-cluster-admin.sh` will configure a GCP project for kaniko builds_
* a kaniko secret (for registry pushes)
* an cluster-admin account to deploy and work with the toolbox
* kubectl


## Installing

We offer a simple installer script that can be used as a standlone with no dependencies on the ForgeOps repository. This will generate a kustomization file in the directory `forgeops-toolbox`, then it will deploy the toolbox

Example:

```
curl -o forgeops-toolbox.sh -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ForgeRock/forgeops/master/bin/forgeops-toolbox.sh
# using defaults configure, deploy, and set the remote for the forked copy of the ForgeOps repo
bash forgeops-toolbox.sh -f https://github.com/mygithuborg/forgeops.git all
```

You will probably want to change some of the default configuration, run `forgeops-toolbox.sh -h` to see the parameters available.

## Using the toolbox

Once the toolbox is deployed, utilizing the toolbox requires an exec into the pod and:
1. Run the bootstrap script to set up the workspace (set up git fork, docker registry and ssh key for pushing to your repo)
2. Add ssh key to to your repo
3. Run the dev build and deploy script
```

Welcome to the Forgeops toolbox!

You'll find a recent clone of the ForgeOps git repository in the current working directory.

You should begin by bootstrapping your workspace using the boostrap-project.sh tool.

Example:
$ bootstrap-project.sh run-bootstrap

More:
$ bootstrap-project.sh -h

forgeops@forgeops-cdk-toolbox-7b86f78b77-tchrv:/opt/workspace$
forgeops@forgeops-cdk-toolbox-7b86f78b77-tchrv:/opt/workspace$ bootstrap-project.sh -r gcr.io/engineering-devops -f https://github.com/maxres-fr/forgeops.git run-bootstrap
# note at somepoint you will be prompted for a password for your SSH key.
```

The toolbox contains tools for working with Skaffold and Kustomize. It also contains vim as well as some debugging tools.

# Security Notes

* The toolbox requires privileges to deploy within a cluster. These privileges are similar to those of a cluster administrator.
* Please be aware that the toolbox runs with escalated Kubernetes API privileges (for deploying)
* If you add the generated ssh key from the toolbox to a repo keep in mind that anyone with cluster access could get a hold of that key. Its safer to not to add it, and copy the repo to your localhost then push from there. e.g. `kubectl cp toolboxpod:/opt/workspace/forgeops /tmp/myforgeopscopy; cd /tmp/myforgeopscopy; git push origin master;`
